"""
The following program calculates the probability of finding a match - a
counter order - for a random order.

Formally, it computes,
p(counter_order_in_next_k_blocks | order_in_this_block)

The calculation makes the assumption that the appearance of an order and
a counter order is NOT independent.

That is,
p(counter_order_in_next_k_blocks, order_in_this_block) != \
    p(counter_order_in_next_k_blocks) * p(order_in_this_block)
